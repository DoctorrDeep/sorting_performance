## Why does this exist?

- trying different sorting techniques to see difference in performance
- understand (if possible) trade-off between heavy computations and number of computations
(a-la would you fight 1 horse sized duck or 100 duck size horses)

## How to run it?

Please run in python 3 for best results. No special packages required.
Some testing/coverage based tests will be written. Those might need a 
look see in the `requirements.txt` file

### Sorting performance
Try sorting algorithms and evaluate performance by 
- total time to solve
- number of steps taken to solve

### Inspiration

- local supermarket is giving out free football player cards
- each card has a number so that unique orders can be established
- this helps in keeping track of what cards we have and which ones we want to trade
- card numbers range from 1 to 250
- arranging all cards in to packs is a daily chore
  - **Pack 1** : unique cards (sorted)
  - **Pack 2**: extra copies of some cards in pack 1

Doing this on the dining table, 
I realized that both me and my son are using various methods
of sorting! Constantly trying new sorting methods to either
- *speed up the process*
- OR *slow it down and dumb it down so that we can do it while chatting or watching cartoons*
